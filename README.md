# deeblingo_backend
The engine that serves the bingo square content to Deeblingo.

Our version of Deeblingo was hosted on AWS Lambda, but anywhere you can make an API call out to will work. Just edit your "allsquares.json" file to include all of your employees and a few of their quirks and the app will do the rest. It doesn't matter how many employees you have or how many quirks per employee, but we do recommend that you try to have roughly the same number of quirks per employee.
